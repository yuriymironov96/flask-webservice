# test-blog
This repository contains my first experience working with Flask microframework.
It is a basic blogging application with registration, posta, comments and moderating.
This project was developed using virtual environment and uses several dependences that are listed in the /requirenets/prod.txt
In order to start an application, run manage.py.
Special thanks to Miguel Grinberg and his book "Flask Web Development" that helped me to get acquainted with Flask microframework.
Have fun!
