# test-blog
This repository contains my experience working with Flask microframework.
This is a simple and minimalistic blog with registration, posting, commenting and moderation.
Developed using virtual environment, all necessary packages are pointed out in the requirements folder.
In order to launch the application, please run the manage.py script using localhost.
Special thanks to Miguel Grinberg and his book "Flask Web Development".
